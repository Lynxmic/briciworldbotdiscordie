# BriciWorld Bot (Discordie)
One of my first Discord bots, from mid 2017. This was the initial code, which uses the Discordie framework.

This bot was later rewritten with Discord.js, taking into consideration the difficulty to work with Discordie, especially as I was a newbie into programming at the time. The bot uses a single JavaScript file containing the essentials for the bot to function, as well as the bot's commands. Everything was updated manually; this can be best reflected in the informational commands, which are very notably outdated.

I can't 100% guarantee this bot will function properly at the current moment; again, this is outdated 2017 code, things functioned very differently back then.
